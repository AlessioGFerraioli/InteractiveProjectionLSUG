# InteractiveProjectionLSUG

An interactive graphic to be projected during music shows and live installation. 
The graphic is composed of a particle systems with three particle types, each with a different icon.
The three icons, which are two witches and a frog, represent the three members of the band [Long Stay Ultra Girls](https://bandcamp.com/longstayultragirls) (I'm the frog). The logo of the band is also floating with the witches and frogs.

The particles move in brownian paths as well as a small rotation animation, which combined simulate an organic movement. 

Their movement also interacts with the input of the webcam. 
An object detected by the webcam  will cause a force on the nearest particles.
The user can toggle the force to be attractive or repulsive, as well as its intensity and other properties of the particles.


This project was made with [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), and it's an adaptation on my previous project [InteractiveParticles](https://github.com/AlessioGFerraioli/InteractiveParticles/tree/main).
